# Machine-Learning-Projects
ML based projects made as a part Machine Learning for Science and Profit. 
The projects are build on topics covered in the course. I aimed at making each project unique and applied machine learining topics to topics I like; from reconstructing gothic architecture to using neural style transfer on Nadir Abdurahmanov's works.
